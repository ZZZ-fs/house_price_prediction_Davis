# house_price_prediction_Davis

In the research, we are interested in studying the housing price fluctuation in Davis. There are lots of potential factors that affect housing price such as number of bedroom(bedroom), number of bathroom(bathroom), gross living area(GLA), lot size(lot_size), year built(year), number of garage(garage) and the distance to the center of the DownTown of Davis(distance). The goal of this experiment is to find out how the housing price will be affected by the different factor and build a model for the significant variables. The approaches we will take in the project are plot including boxplot, histogram, qq-plot and residual plot, Shapiro-Wilks Test, single factor ANOVA, and so on; meanwhile, the confidence level we assume in this research is 95% and the corresponding alpha value is 0.05.
